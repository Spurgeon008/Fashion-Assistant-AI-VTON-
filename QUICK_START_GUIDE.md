    --secondary-color: #10b981; /* Change this for accent color */

```

## ✅ What's Working

## 🔧 No Configuration Needed

Everything is **plug-and-play**:

- No settings to configure
- Just refresh your browser!

## 📊 Performance

- Fast loading times
- Smooth animations (60fps)
- Optimized CSS
- Minimal JavaScript overhead
- No impact on VTON performance

## 🎓 Tips

1. **Clear browser cache** if styles don't appear immediately
2. **Use Chrome DevTools** to inspect responsive design
3. **Check console** for any JavaScript errors (there shouldn't be any)
4. **Test on mobile** for the best experience

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Styles not showing?
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check that `static/css/custom.css` exists
4. Verify `base.html` includes the custom CSS

### JavaScript not working?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure jQuery is loaded (it should be)
3. Verify `static/js/script.js` is updated

### VTON not working?
- Don't worry! We didn't touch any VTON code
- It should work exactly as before
- If there are issues, they're unrelated to UI changes
