## 🔧 Integration Guide

### Backend Integration (Future)

To connect to your Django backend:

1. **Create Review Model**
```python
class Review(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User)
    rating = models.IntegerField()
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    text = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    helpful_count = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    verified_purchase = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

2. **Create Review Form**
```python
class ReviewForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Review
        fields = ['rating', 'title', 'text']
```

3. **Update View**
```python
def product_detail(request, slug):
    product = get_object_or_404(Product, slug=slug)
    reviews = Review.objects.filter(product=product)
    # ... rest of view
```

4. **Update JavaScript**
```javascript
// Replace setTimeout with actual AJAX
$.ajax({
    url: '/submit-review/',
    method: 'POST',
    data: formData,
    success: function(response) {
        // Handle success
    }
});
```
