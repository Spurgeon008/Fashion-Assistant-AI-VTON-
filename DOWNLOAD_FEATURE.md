# Download Feature for VTON Images

## What Was Added

A download button has been added to the Virtual Try-On feature that allows users to save the generated images to their device.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `templates/store/product_detail.html`
- Added a download button below the generated VTON image
- Styled the result image with a border and padding
- Button includes a download icon for better UX

### 2. Updated `templates/base.html`
- Added JavaScript to store the generated image data
- Implemented download functionality that:
  - Creates a temporary download link
  - Triggers automatic download
  - Names the file with timestamp: `virtual-tryon-[timestamp].jpg`
  - Validates that an image exists before downloading

## How It Works

1. **User generates a VTON image** by uploading person and cloth images
2. **Image is displayed** in the result section
3. **Download button appears** below the generated image
4. **User clicks "Download Image"** button
5. **Browser automatically downloads** the image as `virtual-tryon-[timestamp].jpg`

## Features

- ✅ **Automatic filename** with timestamp to avoid overwriting
- ✅ **Validation** - Won't download if no image is generated
- ✅ **Clean UX** - Download icon with clear button text
- ✅ **No server request** - Downloads directly from browser (faster)
- ✅ **JPEG format** - Compatible with all devices

## Usage

1. Go to any product detail page
2. Scroll to "Virtual Try-On" section
3. Upload person and cloth images
4. Click "Generate Try-On (Image)"
5. Wait for the image to generate (10-30 seconds)
6. Click the "Download Image" button
7. Image will be saved to your Downloads folder

## Technical Details

### Download Implementation
```javascript
// Creates a temporary anchor element
var link = document.createElement('a');
link.href = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + generatedImageData;
link.download = 'virtual-tryon-' + Date.now() + '.jpg';

// Triggers download and cleans up
document.body.appendChild(link);
link.click();
document.body.removeChild(link);
```

### File Naming
- Format: `virtual-tryon-[timestamp].jpg`
- Example: `virtual-tryon-1704902400000.jpg`
- Timestamp ensures unique filenames

### Browser Compatibility
Works on all modern browsers:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Opera

## Styling

The download button uses Bootstrap classes:
- `btn btn-success` - Green button styling
- `fas fa-download` - Font Awesome download icon
- `mt-2` - Margin top for spacing

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

You could add:
1. **Custom filename input** - Let users name the file
2. **Multiple format options** - PNG, WEBP, etc.
3. **Quality selector** - Choose image quality
4. **Share button** - Share to social media
5. **Save to gallery** - Save multiple generated images

## Testing

To test the download feature:
1. Generate a VTON image
2. Click the download button
3. Check your Downloads folder
4. Verify the image opens correctly
5. Try generating multiple images to test unique filenames

## Troubleshooting

### Download button not appearing
- Make sure the image generation was successful
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the result div is visible

### Download not working
- Check browser download settings
- Ensure pop-ups/downloads are allowed
- Try a different browser

### File not found after download
- Check your browser's default download location
- Look in Downloads folder
- Check browser's download history (Ctrl+J)

## Summary

Users can now easily download their generated virtual try-on images with a single click. The feature is fast, reliable, and works across all modern browsers.
